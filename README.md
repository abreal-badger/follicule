# follicule
Follicule is a Tampermonkey script that adds (+/-) buttons after every tag and author name on a Ao3 search results page. 

Clicking the + button includes that tag or user to your search criteria.

Clicking the - button excludes them from your search criteria. 

It's basically taking some of the sidebar-filtering functionality and making it a little easier to access when you're browsing search results.
