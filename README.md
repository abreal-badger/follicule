Follicule is a Tampermonkey script for Archive of Our Own that adds (+/-) buttons after every tag and author name when looking at works associated with a tag (fandom, ship, character, etc.)

Clicking the + button includes that tag or user in your search criteria.

Clicking the - button excludes them from your search criteria. 

It's basically taking some of the sidebar-filtering functionality and making it a little easier to access when you're browsing search results.

This script doesn't do anything fancy - it takes the tag name and automates putting it in the filter sidebar UI, saving you some copy-pasting and scrolling.
